## How to Run

This is a static website, so running it is simple:

### Option 1: Open Directly
1. Locate the `index.html` file in the project folder.
2. Open it in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with...).

### Option 2: Run a Local Server (Recommended)
If the troll uses modules or fetch requests, running a local server is recommended:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to start a simple HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
